Intoduction


In this project, we are going to make a Fire Alert System using ATMEGA8 microcontroller and fire sensor. Fire sensor can be of any type, however we are using IR (Infrared) based Fire Sensor. Although IR based Fire Sensors have some disadvantages mostly of inaccuracy, it is the cheapest and easiest way to detect fire.




IR Based Fire sensors have lesser sensing vision, so we are going to mount the fire sensor on a servo motor. The Servo will be making 180 degrees pendulum rotations. With the Fire sensor mounted on it, we get a 270+ degrees fire sensing vision. The servo will be rotating continuously thus giving a complete room fire alert system. For more accuracy we can add a smoke sensor to the system. With that we could get higher accuracy.
